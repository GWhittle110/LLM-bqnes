        "Here is my analysis of the model architectures and proposed search space coordinates:
        
        Task 1 Overview: The provided source code contains 6 different model architectures for image classification on the MNIST dataset, which has 60,000 datapoints and 10 output classes. The architectures include:
        - 2 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with 2 convolutional layers, max pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers 
        - 2 Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) with 4-6 fully connected layers using ReLU or GELU activations and dropout
        - 1 Vision Transformer (ViT) that splits the image into patches, adds positional embeddings, passes through a transformer encoder, and has an MLP head
        - 1 XGBoost model 
        
                
        Task 2 Search Space Features:
        The models vary in their inductive biases, complexity, and how they process the spatial structure of the images. The CNNs use convolutions to hierarchically extract spatial features. The ViT processes patches separately but can learn global interactions through attention. The MLPs and XGBoost treat the images as flat vectors, relying on the fully connected layers or trees to learn patterns.
        The task is image processing, so spatial locality is a particularly important feature.
        The dataset is large with a relatively small number of classes, so overfitting is unlikely to be an issue and complexity is likely to be a dominant performance indicator.


        I propose using the following 4 features as search space dimensions:
        1. Spatial Locality: The degree to which the model architecture leverages the 2D spatial structure of the input images. CNNs consider the entire image at once so would be highest, followed by ViT which considers the spatial attention between patches, then MLPs/XGBoost which consider single pixels.
        2. Representation Power: The theoretical capacity of the model to represent complex functions and learn intricate patterns from the data. Roughly corresponds to model size/depth, and inclusion of more advanced features such as self attention.
        3. Inductive Bias Strength: How much the model architecture encodes useful priors or assumptions for the task, constraining the function space. CNNs and ViT have stronger useful biases than generic MLPs. 
        
        These features capture the key architectural variations and should allow meaningfully separating and clustering the models based on their expected performance on image classification.
        
        Task 3 Model Coordinates:
        
        <models>
        <coordinate index=0>0.8, 0.2, 0.6</coordinate>
        <coordinate index=1>0.9, 0.4, 0.7</coordinate>  
        <coordinate index=2>0.1, 0.5, 0.2</coordinate>
        <coordinate index=3>0.1, 0.8, 0.2</coordinate>
        <coordinate index=4>0.6, 0.7, 0.8</coordinate>
        <coordinate index=5>0.0, 0.6, 0.1</coordinate>
        </models>
        
        Task 4-6 Coordinate Check: The coordinates meaningfully separate the CNNs, ViT, MLPs and XGBoost model. Similar architectures like the two CNNs or two MLPs are closer together.
        The coordinates are continuous values between 0 and 1, not just binary values. The chosen features are also inherently continuous.
        The correlation between features are: -0.63 between Spatial Locality and Representation Power which is acceptable, 0.91 between Spatial Locality and Inductive Bias Strength which is high, and -0.32 between Representation Power and Inductive Bias Strength which is very good. Let me know if you would like me to start again with different coordinates to fix the correlation issue.
